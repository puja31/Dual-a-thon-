This project is done as a part of Dual-a-thon.
We are basically building a healthcare system for elderly.
The best part of this is it is used for Fall Detection for elderly people
We use Iot sensors like pulse sensor,ecg module,temperature and humidity sensor and accelerometer to get the real time health status of an individual.
The values retrieved from the sensors will be sent to Android app using Firebase.
We also use ML RandomForestRegressor model to predict the future diseases.
