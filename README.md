This project is done as a part of Dual-a-thon.
We are basically building a healthcare system for elderly.
We use Iot sensors like pulse sensor,ecg module,temperature and humidity sensor and accelerometer to get the real time health status of an individual.
The values retrieved from the sensors will be sent to Android app using Firebase.
We also use ML random regressor model to predict the future diseases.
